# QGIS Light

QGIS made simple - a light user interface for core GIS functions.

QGIS is a great GIS software loaded with a lot of data visualization and
analysis capabilities. This makes it a suitable tool for GIS experts and alike.
But QGIS is also used by a large group of less technical people, and it is not
uncommon that they encounter difficulties in using the "complex" interface of
QGIS that is full of toolbars, panels, and processing algorithms.

QGIS Light plugin aims to facilitate getting a simple QGIS interface, that is
tailored to the needs of basic users. Our starting point was to support
secondary education and citizen science activities. But a basic interface might
also be useful for anybody that requires core data visualization, editing, and
analysis functionality.

## How to simplify the QGIS interface?

- Install QGIS Light by using the plugin manager.

- Once installed, you will see a tool button with a plain green QGIS logo added
  to the project toolbar. A menu item is also added to the view menu as 'Toggle
  QGIS Light'.
